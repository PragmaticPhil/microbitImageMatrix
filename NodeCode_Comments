To keep the node code slim enough to fit on a micro:bit ALL comments and debug have been removed.
I do not like removing comments so instead I will copy code chunks from mbImageService_Node below and add the relevant comments
Code will change and I will not update below every time, but the meaning of the comments should be preserved:


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 - 'MAIN'

while True:
    sleep(10)
    #   Ensure duration is LESS than standard delay between radio sends in server (25)
    processServerMessage(getServerMessage())
    
    if not(pauseShowFrame):     
        showNextFrame()
        sleep(frameSpeed - 10)
        

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 - RECEIVING AND PRE-FILTERING THE RADIO MESSAGE:


def processServerMessage(rawMsg):
    if(len(rawMsg) < 5): return
    #   more often than not the poll will return the String 'None'.
    #   the shortest valid server message is 5 chars ;)
    #   hence this simple check allows us to eliminate radio clutter that is not worth checking
    
    if(not isValidServerMessage(rawMsg)):    return
    if(rawMsg[2 : 3] == "0"):   processServerInstruction(rawMsg)
    else:                       processImageMessage(rawMsg)

def isValidServerMessage(rawMsg):
    #   try:
    #   With a bit of trepidation I have removed the try / catch blocks from the code - mostly to save space
    #   In theory it is safe here - we've already confirmed the String is at least 5 chars long.
       if(rawMsg[0 : 2] == "pX"):                     # ALL messages sent by server are prefixed with "pX"
          return isRelevantServerMessage(rawMsg)
       return False
    except:
       return False

def isRelevantServerMessage(rawMsg):
# At this stage we know the radio message has come from our server BUT...
# is the message aimed at this node?  Thats what we are checking for below...

#    try:
#   Note - I've hidden the error trapping here because I wanted errors to show up in debug.  
#   Will reinstate at some point, space permitting. 

    if(rawMsg[2 : 3] == "0"):                                           return True      
    #   Returns true if message is a server instruction
    #   Note - not ALL server messages are relevant to ALL nodes (e.g. pX021 and pX022), but this helps in most cases
    
    #   Code below therefore applies to IMAGE carrying data signals from server:
    if((rawMsg[3 : 5] == "00") and (int(rawMsg[9 : 12]) == nodeID)):    return True      
    #   Returns true if message targets this node specifically.
    
    if((rawMsg[3 : 4] == "2") and (int(rawMsg[9 : 12]) == rowRef)):     return True      
    #   Returns true if message is aimed at the row this node occupies
    
    return False
#    except:

    return False
