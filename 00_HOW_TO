HOW TO MAKE IT WORK: 

You need at least 2 micro:bits 

miro:bit1... on the first one flash mbImageService_Node.py. Check the hardcoded ID (should be 0).
... This is your node.
... By default it is node 0
... NodeID is HARDCODED.
... You can add as many nodes as you want.
... For this example server code 4x5 (20) is the max though.
NB - edit the nodeID in code on each node that you add to the matrix


micro:bit2... on the second one flash serverTest_AllIn1_4x5Matrix.py 
... This is your server.
... It will provide image data and instructions to the node. 

Controlling the server: 
A BUTTON:
... click to transmit image data. 
... it toggles - click 1 sends 5 frame animation, click 2 sends 10 frame word

B BUTTON:
... toggle animation type
... click 1 = animation, click 2 = scroll

SHAKE:
... pause / unpause.
... rem = must be unpaused for the animations to work.

TILT LEFT:
... set animation direction to left
... rem - if not animating, is Pause on?

TILT RIGHT:
... set animation direction to right
... rem - if not animating, is Pause on?

The followin functions are not coded:
... reset all nodes
... set frame speed
... synch nodes
I just ran out of input options!
